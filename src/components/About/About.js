                    What is my perfect crime?
                    <br/><br/>
                    I break into Bon Bon Tea House at midnight. Do I go for the vault? No, I go for the boba. It's priceless.
                    As I'm scooping it up, a woman catches me. She tells me to stop. It's her business. She's Ms. Tea House.
                    I say no. We have milk teas all night. In the morning, the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms.
                    I tell her to meet me in Mexico, but I go to Canada. I don't trust her. Besides, I like the cold.
                    Thirty years later, I get a postcard. I have a son; and he's the chief of police. This is where the story
                    gets interesting. I tell Ms. Tea House to meet me in Paris by the Trocadero. She's been waiting for me all 
                    these years. She's never had another milk tea. I don't care. I don't show up. I go to Berlin. 
                    That's were I stashed the boba.
